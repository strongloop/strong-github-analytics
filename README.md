# strong-github-analytics

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/strongloop/strong-github-analytics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/strongloop/strong-github-analytics)

A toolkit that utilizes the strong-github-api for generating analytics data.

## Installation

```
npm i -g strong-github-analytics
sl-gh --help
```

## make-sprint

Use the make-sprint command to generate a common milestone across an
organization's GitHub repositories, or a user's owned repositories.

### Notable Options
- `--org=<orgName>` - The name of your organization in GitHub. For example, if
the URL for your org is `https://github.com/strongloop`, then you'll want to
use `strongloop` as your orgName.
- `--user=<user>` and `--password=<password>` - If you don't have a GitHub token
(really, you should just make one!), then you can use user and password to
authenticate.
- `--title=<title>` - The title of the milestone to create across targets.
- `--description=<desc>` - The text to put into the milestone description.
- `--dryrun` - Will simulate the run to allow you to review and confirm your
targets. Useful if you don't feel like manually deleting dozens of milestones!
For a complete list of options, run `sl-gh make-sprint --help`.

### Example
```
sl-gh make-sprint 2012-12-12 --token=abcdef12345abcdef12345 --org=strongloop --title="Sprint 42"
--description="Sprint to end all sprints!"
```

**Note**: If used under a user's context, this will not generate milestones
for repositories that a user does not own, _even if he/she has appropriate
rights to do so_!


## get-age

Use the get-age command to get the list of issues with their age. 
If an issue is closed, the age is between the date of creation and closed.
If an issue is open, the age is between the current date and the date of creation. 

For a complete list of options, run `sl-gh get-age --help`. 

### Example
The following example gets all the `open` issues in the github repo `somerepo` and save the output to `/Users/somepath/filename.csv`
```
sl-gh get-age myorg/somerepo.git --token=abcdef12345abcdef12345 --status=open --output=/Users/somepath/filename.csv
```
